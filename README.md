They're actually pretty sluggish and shy, and it's believed those fatalies resulted from old-timey medical treatment, not the bites themselves. Still, they say the bite is pretty painful.

Freeze and carefully determine where it's coming from, then slowly step away from the snake.
Scream and run.

Not everyone is lucky enough to hear a rattle. If you touch one by accident they'll probably skip straight to the biting.
